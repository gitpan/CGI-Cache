CGI::Cache - Perl extension to help cache output of time-intensive CGI scripts

CGI::Cache is an easy-to-use module for automatically caching CGI output so
that subsequent visits to such scripts will not take as much time.


NEW IN THIS VERSION

Version 1.4141: wed Dec 22 2004
- Fixed a bug in timed testing 


MODULE DEPENDENCIES

To use this module, you will need to install:

- File::Path
- Tie::Restore
- File::Spec
- Cache::Cache
- Storable

You should be prompted to install this module automatically when you run "perl
Makefile.PL".


INSTALLATION

To install this package, change to the directory where you unarchived this
distribution and type the following:

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make test
  make install

You can install this package into a non-default location by appending one of
the following to the "perl Makefile.PL" command:

- "PREFIX=/installation/path" (for installation into a custom location),
- "INSTALLDIRS=site" (for installation into site-specific Perl directories)
- "INSTALLDIRS=perl" (for installation into standard Perl directories).

If you make the installation into your own directory, then remember that you
must tell perl where to search for modules before trying to 'use' them. For
example:

  use lib '/home/userid/lib';
  use CGI::Cache;

During the 'make test', there are some tests that take a while longer to run.
While testing that caching is working, CPU times are being recorded on some
slow code to see that performance will actually be increased on subsequent
visits.  Don't panic. It may take a couple of minutes to run, depending on
your system.


DOCUMENTATION

Just "perldoc CGI::Cache". After installation on Unix systems,
you can also do "man CGI::Cache".
