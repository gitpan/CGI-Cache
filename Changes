Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Cache.

0.99  Wed Jun 17 20:06:08 EST 1998
	- Added some modifications to the docs. There is a BUGS
	  piece of info wrt signals that kill your process and
	  make the module misbehave.
	- I added the Copyright info and license info as suggested
	  by the docs at /CPAN/modules/04pause.html. Those are
	  agreeable terms.
	- misc. formatting of docs.
	- hopefully ready for submission to PAUSE now... :-)

	- Took my existing CGI caching work and rolled it into
	  this module, hoping to get a first stab at working
	  distribution. I'm using a "closer-to 1.0" version,
	  as the guts of this module have already been around
	  and working for a while.
