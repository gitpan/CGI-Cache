Revision history for Perl extension CGI::Cache.

1.03  Mon Jan 29 21:56:50 EST 2001
  - Now prevents caching of output for applications which call a $SIG{__DIE__}
    that doesn't print to STDERR. An example of this type of application is
    "CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser)"

1.02  Mon Nov 13 00:07:24 EST 2000
  - Fixed issues to make module mod_perl compatible. (Thanks to Trevor
    Henthorn <trevor@console.net> for the bug report.)
  - Fixed stop() documentation. (Thanks to Trevor Henthorn
    <trevor@console.net> for the bug report.)
  - Moved development to SourceForge. 
    (http://CGICache.sourceforge.net/)
  - Fixed warnings about tie under Perl 5.6. (Thanks to Douglas Wilson
    <dougw@racesearch.com> for the report and fix suggestion)

1.01  Mon Oct  2 18:18:25 EDT 2000
  - Maintenance handed over to David Coppit <david@coppit.org>. All
    changes in this version are made by him.
  - Underlying caching is now handled by File::Cache. This allows for extra
    features such as cache maximum sizes, transparent cache entry expiration,
    etc.
  - The cache key can now be any data structure instead of just a simple
    string. This means that one can just hand the CGI parameters directly to
    CGI::Cache and it will figure out a suitable stringified cache key.
  - Because File::Cache now does most of the cache management automatically,
    SetRoot, Expire, and ExpireLRU have been removed from the interface
  - Output is now cached and then printed as each print statement occurs.
    Previously all the output would be dumped to STDOUT after the script
    completed execution. (This helps the responsiveness of the CGI script for
    browsers which can handle on-the-fly layout of web pages.)
  - Output is not cached if the script exits from an error condition.
    Previously, a problem with the script would cause an empty document to be
    cached.
  - A setup(\%options) subroutine has been added for setting up the details of
    the cache.
  - The file mode parameter for most functions has been removed. Instead, the
    file mode is set when initializing the module using the setup(\%options)
    subroutine.

1.00  Thu Jun 25 20:47:30 EST 1998
	- Added routine ExpireLRU() per suggestion from Daniel LaLiberte.

0.99  Wed Jun 17 20:06:08 EST 1998
	- Added some modifications to the docs. There is a BUGS
	  piece of info wrt signals that kill your process and
	  make the module misbehave.
	- I added the Copyright info and license info as suggested
	  by the docs at /CPAN/modules/04pause.html. Those are
	  agreeable terms.
	- misc. formatting of docs.
	- hopefully ready for submission to PAUSE now... :-)

0.98  Tue Jun  2 17:45:30 EST 1998
	- Took my existing CGI caching work and rolled it into
	  this module, hoping to get a first stab at working
	  distribution. I'm using a "closer-to 1.0" version,
	  as the guts of this module have already been around
	  and working for a while.

0.01  Thu May 28 18:07:00 1998
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18
