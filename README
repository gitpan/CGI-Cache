CGI::Cache

Copyright (c) 1998 Broc Seib. All rights reserved. This program
is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the same terms as Perl itself.


To install this package, change to the directory where you
unarchived this distribution and type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

During the 'make test', there are some tests that take a while
longer to run. While testing that caching is working, CPU times
are being recorded on some badly written code to see that
performance will actually be increased on subsequent visits.
Don't panic. It may take a couple of minutes to run, depending
on your system.

If you do not have root access on your machine, then you may
not have the ability to install this module in the standard
perl library path. You may direct the installation into your
own space, e.g.,

	perl Makefile.PL LIB='/home/bseib/lib'

or perhaps the entire installation, e.g.,

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX='/home/bseib'

If you make the installation into your own directory, then
remember that you must tell perl where to search for modules
before trying to 'use' them. For example:

	use lib '/home/bseib/lib';
	use CGI::Cache;


The most current version of this module should be available
at your favorite CPAN site, or may be retrieved from
  http://icd.cc.purdue.edu/~bseib/pub/CGI-Cache-X.XX.tar.gz

Please let me know if you are using this module. Tell me what
bugs you find or what can be done to improve it.
