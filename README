CGI::Cache

Perl extension to help cache output of time- intensive CGI scripts so that
subsequent visits to such scripts will not cost as much time.


WARNING! The interface in this version of CGI::Cache is incompatible
with the interface of version 1.00 and earlier. You will need to
modify any existing scripts you have to use the new interface if you
install this version.

WARNING! The interface changed slightly in version 1.20.


NEW IN THIS VERSION

1.40
- Added clear() function to clear the cache.


MODULE DEPENDENCIES

You will need to install Cache::Cache to use CGI::Cache. You can get the
latest version from:

  http://www.perl.com/CPAN/authors/id/D/DC/DCLINTON/

Alternatively, installation of Cache::Cache and its dependencies can be done
automatically using the CPAN module:

  perl -MCPAN -e 'install Cache::Cache'


INSTALLATION

To install this package, change to the directory where you
unarchived this distribution and type the following:

	perl Makefile.PL
	make
	make test
	make install

You can also use "perl Makefile.PL FORCE_INSTALL" to avoid prompts which ask
if it is okay to install the new version even if it is potentially
incompatible with scripts written using the older version found on the
system.

During the 'make test', there are some tests that take a while
longer to run. While testing that caching is working, CPU times
are being recorded on some badly written code to see that
performance will actually be increased on subsequent visits.
Don't panic. It may take a couple of minutes to run, depending
on your system.

If you do not have root access on your machine, then you may
not have the ability to install this module in the standard
perl library path. You may direct the installation into your
own space, e.g.,

	perl Makefile.PL LIB='/home/userid/lib'

or perhaps the entire installation, e.g.,

	perl Makefile.PL PREFIX='/home/userid'

If you make the installation into your own directory, then
remember that you must tell perl where to search for modules
before trying to 'use' them. For example:

	use lib '/home/userid/lib';
	use CGI::Cache;


NOTES

Please let me know if you are using this module. Tell me what
bugs you find or what can be done to improve it.
